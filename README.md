# machine-learning project with knime: diabetes classification


Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that arises due to abnormally high levels of blood glucose, known as hyperglycemia. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to mitigate life- threatening risks associated with this condition.Fortunately, advances in technology have enabled earlier detection of the disease.In this study, we have developed a decision support system using machine learning algorithms to aid in DM diagnosis.
Our approach begins with a very detailed exploratory data analysis, followed by data pre-processing and feature selection techniques. Important features are selected, and the data is trained using four different machine learning algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron. Performance metrics were used to evaluate the experimental results of the machine learning algorithms.
